### Ricardo Mendes

- I'm a junior backend developer from Brazil
- I like to listen to some rock, here're some playlists if you like to check it out
    - [foo bar](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5xUXvWEyx42mjlIegvXTCL?si=SRS3HYiZRFG3c5HPmhZQ4w) and [lorem ipsum](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/579aXG4V1ck3m6MxLANKp9?si=ebD-TKarTHCj-lbQOVQ3yA)
- Today I'm working with PHP, but my preferences are Python and JavaScript
- I'm working on my [portfolio](https://ricardobr001.github.io). Today It's only available in `Portuguese - Brazilian (pt-br)`, but in a few days It'll be available in `pt-br` and `English (en)`, I'm rewriting It in React :)
